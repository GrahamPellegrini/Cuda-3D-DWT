# CUDA 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform (3D-DWT)

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the **CCE3015 â€“ High Performance Computing** course at the **University of Malta**, under the supervision of **Prof. Johann A. Briffa**.

The projectâ€™s objective was to explore and implement a **3D Discrete Wavelet Transform (3D-DWT)**, starting from a serial CPU-based approach and progressing to a CUDA-optimized parallel implementation using GPU acceleration.

The dataset used for the implementation and testing is from the **CHAOS Challenge**:

### Course Project Phases

The project was conducted in three parts:
1. **Lab Exercises**: Foundation in CUDA and parallel computing.
2. **Serial Implementation**: A baseline 3D-DWT algorithm developed in C/C++.
3. **Parallel CUDA Implementation**: A GPU-accelerated version aiming to significantly reduce computation time.

> ðŸ“„ **Both implementations are accompanied by formal reports** located in the `docs/` folder, submitted as part of the unitâ€™s coursework.
